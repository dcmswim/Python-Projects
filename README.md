# Python-Projects
 Python Projects created during Tech Academy course

Description of Projects: 

"Checkbook_Project": This is a web app created using the Django framework. It allows users to create a profile, mark their starting "bank balance" and keep track of deposits and withdrawals. App keeps a running total of the user's current balance depending on user inputs regarding deposits and withdrawals. Uses sqlite to store user's info in a database for future reference. 

"Django University": This is a web app created using the Django framework to practice creating a site where users can add and remove profiles. Allows users to add profiles with name and specify what courses they are taking in a fictional university.

"GUI_Exercise": App created using Python and tkinter. The purpose was to create a simple GUI that allows the user to select a source directory and a destination directory. All files in the source directory that had been created or modified within the past 24 hours are transferred to the destination directory. 

"Student_Tracking_Assignment": App created using Python and tkinter. The purpose was to create a GUI using tkinter and give the user the ability to add info to a database for later retrieval. Users are able to view a list of all users in the database and can retrieve their info by selecting the names from a list. Users also have the ability to update or delete their info which will reflect in the database. 

"File Transfer": Similar to the GUI_Exercise, this was more practice with creating a GUI in tkinter allowing users to select directories and transfer files. 

"Page_Generator": Basic app created using Python. User interface created via tkinter that allows user to input body text for a webpage. Text submitted in the field is written to a new HTML file that opens in a new window. Practice for python write commands. 

"Python_dB_assignment": Practice with using SQL commands in Python. Creates a list of files in a database then returns only those files that end with a certain extension. 

"techproject": Web App created using the Django framework. Purpose was to practice creating a functional dynamic site using Django. The site is for a fictional hotel called "Royal Hotels". Users can view a list of menu items offered by the hotel which includes information such as price, name, and description. Users can add, remove, and update items on the list (this part of the app would be tailored towards the owners of the hotel via access to admin privileges). A sqlite database keeps track of the items stored on the menu and will update accordingly with user input.
